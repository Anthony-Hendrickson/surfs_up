## Overview of the statistical analysis:
The purpose of this analysis was to find out whether it would be hot enough in the location in Hawaii in which we proposed opening an Ice-cream and surf shop. In order to do so, we took weather data from nearby weather towers in order to determine whether the temperature would be suitable.

## Result:

The analysis produced the following results for the months of June and December respectively:

The main insights gathered from this analysis are as follows:
1. It is 4 degrees farenheit warmer on average in June than in December.
2. The temperature fluctuation in December is greater than in June.
3. Even when temperatures are in the lowest percentile in December, it remains quite warm in this location at 69 degrees farenheit which I believe is a reasonable temperature at which to tempt individuals with icecream and surfing.

## Summary:

The analysis supports opening an ice-cream and surf shop in this location. However I would also examine a number of other inquiries in order support the location including:
1. Precipitation analysis; nobody wants to eat icecream in the rain.
2. Overcast/Sunny weather analysis; I believe this would also have an impact on peoples appetite to surf and eat icecream.
3. Pegging down the weather to the time of day to consider what the best hours of operations would be given all of the above.
